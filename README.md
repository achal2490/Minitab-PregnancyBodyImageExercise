# Minitab-PregnancyBodyImageExercise
Analyse effects of exercise on a woman’s perception of her body during and after pregnancy 

A randomised trial of the effects of an appropriate exercise regime on a woman’s perception of her body during and after a normal, healthy singleton pregnancy was carried out in Ayrshire, Scotland.   Sixty women, recently pregnant for the first time, were recruited and randomised to be controls or to attend weekly exercise regimes (designed to be suitable for women throughout pregnancy).  Otherwise every one of the 60 women were to carry on the pregnancy as they saw fit including any exercise.
Each woman filled in a questionnaire as to how she perceived her own body at two distinct times; one at 12 weeks into the pregnancy and the other at 12 weeks after the baby was born (all births produced healthy babies).  One component of this questionnaire allowed the calculation of a measure of the woman’s “body image” with high values on this scale of 0 to 40 denoting women who have a good perception of their own body image.
